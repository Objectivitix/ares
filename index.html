          From the studio behind the universally acclaimed <i>Aion</i> trilogy
          comes another genre-redefining massively multiplayer experience.
        </b></p>
        <p>
          Set 12 years before the events of <i>Aion</i>, <i>Ares</i> explores the
          origin of the Oblivion War, recounting the events that led to the
          apocalyptic event. <i>Ares</i> simulates international politics by dividing
          millions of players into 30 fictitious Nations, each gouverned by a unique
          administration with its own ideology.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>You control <em>everything</em></h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          Peace or war, life or death - it's all up to the players. <i>Ares</i>'
          extremely complex System evolves in real time as players form alliances and
          hostilities. An intricate web of related and conflicting Objectives will set
          the Game in motion; Nations shall compete to be the first to complete them all.
          As the Game progresses, special events (no spoilers!) may trigger in real time
          based on the state of the System.
        </p>
        <p>
          You play as <i>anyone</i>: a civilian (spectator), a soldier, a secret agent,
          a millionaire, a gouvernment official. If you were a significant contributor in
          the <i>Aion</i> trilogy, you can play as a higher-level politician. As you
          complete Missions and gain experience points, you advance in the hierarchy.
          But beware: go high enough and you may find yourself facing enemies coming not
          only from other Nations.
        </p>

      <h1>What's stopping everyone from just doing nothing and keeping peace?</h1>
      <div>
        <p><b>
          Humans when met with material gain. The catalyst: $50 000 000 (50 million),
          distributed to players of the first Nation having completed all Objectives.
        </b></p>
        <p>
          If less than half a million people (including NPCs) remain, the Nation with
          the most Objectives completed wins. If the global population remains above 100
          million exactly 900 days after launch (Peace Ending), only $3 000 000 is
          distributed, and to all Nations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Distribution by hierarchy</b>: the higher your Level, the more money you
          win. However, if Peace Ending is reached, you'd need to be in a quite a high
          position to win a considerable amount.
